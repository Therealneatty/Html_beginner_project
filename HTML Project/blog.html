 <p>Autumn is officially here and I could not be more excited about the change of season!  There’s just something about the crisp chill of jacket weather and changing leaves –  fabulous tall boots and football season – that gets me every year.  But the best part of fall simply has to be the baking season.  From now until January, there’s just so many opportunities to bake up something delicious!  Today I wanted to share some of the cupcakes recipes that I’m personally eyeing this year.  A few of these you’ve seen here on the blog before.  The others have been patiently waiting on my Pinterest cupcake board for far too long.  It’s time to preheat that oven and get going!  Here’s 10 Cupcakes to Bake This Fall!</p>
 <p>You just can’t go wrong with this one – it’s one of our most popular fall recipes!  Pumpkin Cupcakes by Lauren Kapeluck for The Cake Blog.  These pumpkin cupcakes are full of fall flavors featuring cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger and then topped with a cinnamon cream cheese frosting.  Recipe Here.</p>
